# NEO stands for near-Earth object. The Center for NEO Studies
# (`CNEOS <http://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/>`__) defines NEOs as comets and
# asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of
# nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earthâ€™s
# neighborhood.
# 
# And what does "near" exactly mean? In terms of orbital elements,
# asteroids and comets can be considered NEOs if their perihelion (orbit
# point which is nearest to the Sun) is less than 1.3 au = 1.945 \* 108 km
# from the Sun.

# DASTCOM5 module
# ---------------
# 
# This module can also be used to get NEOs orbit, in the same way that
# ``neows``, but it have some advantages (and some disadvantages).
# 
# It relies on DASTCOM5 database, a NASA/JPL maintained asteroid and comet
# database. This database has to be downloaded at least once in order to
# use this module. According to its README, it is updated typically a
# couple times per day, but potentially as frequently as once per hour, so
# you can download it whenever you want the more recently discovered
# bodies. This also means that, after downloading the file, you can use
# the database offline.
# 
# The file is a ~230 MB zip that you can manually
# `download <ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/ssd/dastcom5.zip>`__ and unzip in
# ``~/.poliastro`` or, more easily, you can use
# 
# .. code:: python
# 
#     dastcom5.download_dastcom5()
# 


######################################################################
# The main DASTCOM5 advantage over NeoWs is that you can use it to search
# not only NEOs, but any asteroid or comet. The easiest function is
# ``orbit_from_name()``:
# 

from poliastro.neos import dastcom5

atira = dastcom5.orbit_from_name("atira")[0]  # NEO
wikipedia = dastcom5.orbit_from_name("wikipedia")[0]  # Asteroid, but not NEO.

frame = StaticOrbitPlotter()
frame.plot(atira, label="Atira (NEO)")
frame.plot(wikipedia, label="Wikipedia (asteroid)");
plt.show()


######################################################################
# Keep in mind that this function returns a list of orbits matching your
# string. This is made on purpose given that there are comets which have
# several records in the database (one for each orbit determination in
# history) what allow plots like this one:
# 

halleys = dastcom5.orbit_from_name("1P")
print("THIS IS HALLEYS LIST:", halleys)

frame = StaticOrbitPlotter()
frame.plot(halleys[0], label="Halley")
frame.plot(halleys[5], label="Halley")
frame.plot(halleys[10], label="Halley")
frame.plot(halleys[20], label="Halley")
frame.plot(halleys[-1], label="Halley");
plt.show()


######################################################################
# While ``neows`` can only be used to get Orbit objects, ``dastcom5`` can
# also provide asteroid and comet complete database. Once you have this,
# you can get specific data about one or more bodies. The complete
# databases are ``ndarrays``, so if you want to know the entire list of
# available parameters, you can look at the ``dtype``, and they are also
# explained in `documentation API
# Reference <https://docs.poliastro.space/en/latest/api/safe/neos/dastcom5_parameters.html>`__:
# 

ast_db = dastcom5.asteroid_db()
comet_db = dastcom5.comet_db()
ast_db.dtype.names[
    :20
]  # They are more than 100, but that would be too much lines in this notebook :P


######################################################################
# .. raw:: html
# 
#    <div class="alert alert-info">
# 
# Asteroid and comet parameters are not exactly the same (although they
# are very close)
# 
# .. raw:: html
# 
#    </div>
# 


######################################################################
# With these ``ndarrays`` you can classify asteroids and comets, sort
# them, get all their parameters, and whatever comes to your mind.
# 
# For example, NEOs can be grouped in several ways. One of the NEOs group
# is called ``Atiras``, and is formed by NEOs whose orbits are contained
# entirely with the orbit of the Earth. They are a really little group,
# and we can try to plot all of these NEOs using ``asteroid_db()``:
# 


######################################################################
# Talking in orbital terms, ``Atiras`` have an aphelion distance,
# ``Q < 0.983 au`` and a semi-major axis, ``a < 1.0 au``. Visiting
# `documentation API
# Reference <https://docs.poliastro.space/en/latest/api/safe/neos/dastcom5_parameters.html>`__,
# you can see that DASTCOM5 provides semi-major axis, but doesn't provide
# aphelion distance. You can get aphelion distance easily knowing
# perihelion distance (q, QR in DASTCOM5) and semi-major axis
# ``Q = 2*a - q``, but there are probably many other ways.
# 

aphelion_condition = 2 * ast_db["A"] - ast_db["QR"] < 0.983
axis_condition = ast_db["A"] < 1.3
atiras = ast_db[aphelion_condition & axis_condition]


######################################################################
# The number of ``Atira NEOs`` we use using this method is:
# 

print(len(atiras))


######################################################################
# Which is consistent with the `stats published by
# CNEOS <https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/totals.html>`__
# 


######################################################################
# Now we're gonna plot all of their orbits, with corresponding labels,
# just because we love plots :)
# 
# We only need to get the 16 orbits from these 16 ``ndarrays``.
# 
# There are two ways:
# 
# -  Gather all their orbital elements manually and use the
#    ``Orbit.from_classical()`` function.
# -  Use the ``NO`` property (logical record number in DASTCOM5 database)
#    and the ``dastcom5.orbit_from_record()`` function.
# 
# The second one seems easier and it is related to the current notebook,
# so we are going to use that one, using the ``ASTNAM`` property of
# DASTCOM5 database:
# 

from poliastro.bodies import Earth

earth = Orbit.from_body_ephem(Earth)
frame = StaticOrbitPlotter()
frame.plot(earth, label=Earth)

for record in atiras["NO"]:
    ss = dastcom5.orbit_from_record(record).to_icrs()
    frame.plot(ss, color="#666666")
plt.show()


######################################################################
# If we needed also the names of each asteroid, we could do:
# 

frame = StaticOrbitPlotter()

frame.plot(earth, label=Earth)

for i in range(len(atiras)):
    record = atiras["NO"][i]
    label = atiras["ASTNAM"][i].decode().strip()  # DASTCOM5 strings are binary
    ss = dastcom5.orbit_from_record(record).to_icrs()
    frame.plot(ss, label=label)
plt.show()


######################################################################
# .. raw:: html
# 
#    <div class="alert alert-info">
# 
# We knew beforehand that there are no ``Atira`` comets, only asteroids
# (comet orbits are usually more eccentric), but we could use the same
# method with ``com_db`` if we wanted.
# 
# .. raw:: html
# 
#    </div>
# 


######################################################################
# Finally, another interesting function in ``dastcom5`` is
# ``entire_db()``, which is really similar to ``ast_db`` and ``com_db``,
# but it returns a ``Pandas dataframe`` instead of a ``numpy ndarray``.
# The dataframe has asteroids and comets in it, but in order to achieve
# that (and a more manageable dataframe), a lot of parameters were
# removed, and others were renamed:
# 

db = dastcom5.entire_db()
print(db.columns)


######################################################################
# Also, in this function, DASTCOM5 data (specially strings) is ready to
# use (decoded and improved strings, etc):
# 

db[
    db.NAME == "Halley"
]  # As you can see, Halley is the name of an asteroid too, did you know that?


######################################################################
# Panda offers many functionalities, and can also be used in the same way
# as the ``ast_db`` and ``comet_db`` functions:
# 

aphelion_condition = (2 * db["A"] - db["QR"]) < 0.983
axis_condition = db["A"] < 1.3
atiras = db[aphelion_condition & axis_condition]

print(len(atiras))


######################################################################
# What? I said they can be used in the same way!
# 


######################################################################
# Dont worry :) If you want to know what's happening here, the only
# difference is that we are now working with comets too, and some comets
# have a negative semi-major axis!
# 

print(len(atiras[atiras.A < 0]))


######################################################################
# So, rewriting our condition:
# 

axis_condition = (db["A"] < 1.3) & (db["A"] > 0)
atiras = db[aphelion_condition & axis_condition]
print(len(atiras))
